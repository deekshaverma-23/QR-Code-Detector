QR and Barcode Detector Using OpenCV

This project implements a QR code and barcode detection system using OpenCV. It processes images or live video streams to detect, decode, and display the information embedded in QR codes and barcodes.

Features:
1. Real-Time Detection: Supports detection from live video feeds or static images.
2. Multi-Format Support: Detects both QR codes and standard barcodes.
3. Information Extraction: Decodes embedded text, URLs, or other data from detected codes.
4. Interactive Visualization: Highlights detected codes and overlays decoded information on the video feed.
